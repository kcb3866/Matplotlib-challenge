# Matplotlib-challenge

This challenge uses data from an animal study to determine which drug would be best used to treat cancer. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens.
